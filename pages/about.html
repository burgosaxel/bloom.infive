          <h2>Hi, I’m Angelika Burgos</h2>

          <p class="muted">
            I'm a wife and mom of three amazing kids who inspire me every single day.
            I started writing at 14, mostly romance stories, but life pulled me in other directions.
            Even though I paused my storytelling, I kept journaling, writing notes, reflections,
            and little daily observations.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            Until one day, motherhood brought new stories and a fresh perspective.
            My mom always encouraged me to write a book, believing that life with me around
            was never ordinary. But only through God’s guidance, writing found its way back
            into my life.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            I began turning everyday moments into stories, discovering that writing from the
            heart and capturing life’s small, but meaningful details, has a depth all its own.
            Now, I’m lucky enough to enjoy my passion for writing while living the extraordinary
            adventure of raising my children.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            Hoping to leave behind stories that linger in the hearts of the readers.
